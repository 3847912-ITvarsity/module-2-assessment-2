    <p>When Melinda met Robert, she was sceptical of his charming nature, but couldn't deny how attracted she was to him. Once they fell in love, Melinda moulded herself into everything he wanted her to be. She sacrificed for him, worked to support his grandiose dreams, and put up with him for better or for worse. Then, one day she realised that, after all she had done, another woman was reaping the lavish rewards. That's when Melinda lost it, and now she cannot let it go.</p>
